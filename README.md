# Govrn curates datasets from web3 so that they are broadly accessible to academic and citizen researchers

Web3 organizations like DAOs generate troves of useful data, but the data can be be difficult for academic researchers who are not familiar with blockchain and web3 jargon to wrangle, utilize, or contextualize. Govrn wants to make these datasets accessible to broader academic and citizen audiences because these datasets have implications for public goods research, crowdfunding, governance, and more. These topics deserve to be well-studied.
